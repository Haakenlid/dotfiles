Event Designators
=================

An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list.  Unless  the  reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.

!      Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, newline, = or (.
!n     Refer to command line n.
!-n    Refer to the current command minus n.
!!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
!string
        Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list starting with string.
!?string[?]
        Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list  containing string.  The trailing ? may be omitted if string is followed immediately by a newline.
^string1^string2^
        Quick  substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing string1 with string2.  Equivalent to ``!!:s/string1/string2/'' (see Modifiers below).
!#     The entire command line typed so far.
